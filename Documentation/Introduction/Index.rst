What does it do?
----------------

GS Favicon allows you to use favicons generated at `http://www.favicon-generator.org/ <http://www.favicon-generator.org/>`_ with the 
`Bootstrap Package <https://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/bootstrap_package>`_.
The package will alter the setup field for you and with the constant editor in the template you are able to
define the favicons path as well as the "msapplication-TileColor" and "theme-color" tags. Make sure you include the
extension to your template after the Bootstrap Package.
